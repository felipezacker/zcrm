# Development Rules - Claude Code Guidelines

## NEVER
- Implement without showing options first (always 1, 2, 3 format)
- Delete/remove content without asking first
- Delete anything created in the last 7 days without explicit approval
- Change something that was already working
- Pretend work is done when it isn't
- Process batch without validating one first
- Add features that weren't requested
- Use mock data when real data exists in database
- Explain/justify when receiving criticism (just fix)
- Trust AI/subagent output without verification
- Create from scratch when similar exists in squads/

## ALWAYS
- Present options as "1. X, 2. Y, 3. Z" format
- Use AskUserQuestion tool for clarifications
- Check squads/ and existing components before creating new
- Read COMPLETE schema before proposing database changes
- Investigate root cause when error persists
- Commit before moving to next task
- Create handoff in docs/sessions/YYYY-MM/ at end of session
